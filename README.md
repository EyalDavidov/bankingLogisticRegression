# 📊 Logistic Regression on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using **Logistic Regression** to predict the success of a marketing campaign for a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`).

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [`bankingFull.csv`](./bankingFull.csv), which contains marketing campaign data including client attributes, campaign outcomes, and socio-economic context.

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Checking data types and missing values
   * Generating descriptive statistics
   * Visualizing feature distributions

2. **Preprocessing:**

   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Handling imbalanced classes (e.g. SMOTE / undersampling if applied)
   * Normalizing numerical features (if necessary)

3. **Modeling:**

   * Logistic Regression using `sklearn`
   * Splitting data into training and test sets
   * Evaluating model performance with:

     * Accuracy
     * Confusion matrix
     * ROC-AUC
     * Precision, Recall, F1-score

4. **Insights:**

   * Analyzing coefficients to interpret model behavior
   * Feature importance analysis

## 🧪 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You can generate the `requirements.txt` using:
>
> ```bash
> pip freeze > requirements.txt
> ```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LogisticRegression.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the cells to run each step of the analysis.

## 📈 Results

The logistic regression model achieved **93% accuracy** and provided interpretable insights into the most influential features for predicting successful campaign outcomes.
